-- Check out the Xaw3d library available on ftp.x.org in the
   contrib/Xaw3d directory.  Without any changes to your source code
   you can get a nice 3D  motif-ish look to your application.  All you
   have to do is link with -lXaw3d instead of -lXaw, and poof, all
   your widgets now have a nice 3D look to them.  I highly reccomend 
   this library.
